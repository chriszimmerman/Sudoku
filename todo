Must do:

Error handle parsing a file
Moving the possible value range generation into a method
Make parent object for solver and have two children: 1) generator 2) partial solution solver

Nice to have:

Checking other characters for blanks spaces other than "_"
Having irregular zones (e.g. 6x6 grid with 3x2 blocks)
