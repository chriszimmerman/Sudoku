What's wrong with hating family get-together?!
<SYNC Start=12339><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=25579><P>
how do you tie this...
<SYNC Start=26836><P>&nbsp;

How to tie a tie
<SYNC Start=33497><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=61631><P>
Good morning
<SYNC Start=63341><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=64910><P>
Wow you're wearing a tie!  How unusual!
<SYNC Start=69203><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=69884><P>
Today's the my father's "san kaiki" (3rd anniversary of death)
<SYNC Start=71869><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=72671><P>
Why is it "san kaiki" even though he died 2 years ago?
<SYNC Start=75554><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=76051><P>
Um...
<SYNC Start=78003><P>
Do you think that tie is ok?
<SYNC Start=79757><P>
What about it?
<SYNC Start=81244><P>
I think it's still black tie for "san kaiki"...
<SYNC Start=85739><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=88697><P>
Sheesh, anniversary service is such a nuisance...
<SYNC Start=91984><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=95186><P>
I say it nicely and not even a thanks
<SYNC Start=99020><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=103226><P>&nbsp;
<font color="#FF9C9C">
For "san kaiki", black tie is appropriate
<SYNC Start=106565><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=123421><P>
Thank you for coming
<SYNC Start=125958><P>
- Don't mention it<br>
- Here have some
<SYNC Start=128934><P>
Shinsuke, pour me a glass
<SYNC Start=131226><P>
- Um, even with your busy schedule, thank..<br>
- You know Ikuyo-san...
<SYNC Start=135632><P>
Only Shinsuke needs to get married now
<SYNC Start=139892><P>
As the elder son, only you can continue on Kuwano's name
<SYNC Start=142976><P>
Your late father,
<SYNC Start=145357><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=145892><P>
even on that night (he passed away),
<SYNC Start=147377><P>
was worried about you
<SYNC Start=151309><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=151739><P>
Well, yeah
<SYNC Start=152842><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=153132><P>
How about Yoshikawa's daughter?
<SYNC Start=156176><P>
Her husband passed away last year
<SYNC Start=159495><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=160258><P>
Fumi's husband is still alive and well!
<SYNC Start=163635><P>
But shinsuke...
<SYNC Start=165652><P>
you know you're not in a position turn away people with previous marriage experience
<SYNC Start=171002><P>
Yes I know
<SYNC Start=172424><P>
Don't worry it's ok!
<SYNC Start=173739><P>
Marriage happens by fate
<SYNC Start=175660><P>
All of a sudden,
<SYNC Start=176604><P>
one day a good prospect can appear out of nowhere!
<SYNC Start=179696><P>
It would be nice if that was the case...
<SYNC Start=182122><P>
It's ok don't worry!
<SYNC Start=183876><P>
Ikuyo-san, how about living with Shinsuke until then?
<SYNC Start=188014><P>
No thank you!
<SYNC Start=189609><P>
Not with this cold selfish guy
<SYNC Start=191885><P>
How about living with Keiko?
<SYNC Start=193324><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=194308><P>
Well that would be 100 times better
<SYNC Start=197108><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=197584><P>
Since Yumi is there too
<SYNC Start=199293><P>
That's right<br>
I wish you'd live with us too
<SYNC Start=202084><P>
- Right, honey?<br>
- Uh.. umm yeah.
<SYNC Start=204803><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=209751><P>
Why do they always say the same thing every time we meet?
<SYNC Start=212666><P>
It's because you're making them.
<SYNC Start=216960><P>
Hey honey
<SYNC Start=218348><P>
- What kind of reaction was that?<br>
- Hrmm what?
<SYNC Start=221332><P>
Your face changed<br>
You don't want to live with her, right?
<SYNC Start=224243><P>
No that's not it
<SYNC Start=226282><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=229031><P>
Don't worry<br>
I have no plan to leave my current home
<SYNC Start=233591><P>
But you'll let me live in an ash vase in your house after I die, right?
<SYNC Start=238360><P>
Yes, by all means
<SYNC Start=240910><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=241510><P>
I have work, so I'll get going
<SYNC Start=244998><P>
What?
<SYNC Start=245985><P>
You don't need a ride?
<SYNC Start=247688><P>
I want to get away from these people as soon as possible
<SYNC Start=250264><P>
Later
<SYNC Start=250979><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=254546><P>
Even in an ash vase,
<SYNC Start=256261><P>
I don't want to live with him
<SYNC Start=258567><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=260105><P>
You're going to have separate entrances?
<SYNC Start=262001><P>
Of course
<SYNC Start=263448><P>
Even though it's a multi-family home,
<SYNC Start=265241><P>
we still need our prviacy
<SYNC Start=267297><P>
Why do you need two entrances for one house?
<SYNC Start=272166><P>
Inside, we can build a door that connects two units
<SYNC Start=275705><P>
Isn't it nice just that fact that we'll be living together
<SYNC Start=280062><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=282770><P>
We run into this issue even at work
<SYNC Start=284874><P>
Today is an aging society,
<SYNC Start=286722><P>
so we'll be seeing more houses with 2 generations living together
<SYNC Start=289646><P>
Maybe we should build a ring inside so they can duke it out
<SYNC Start=292712><P>
Ring instead of a living (room) huh...
<SYNC Start=295347><P>
After seeing these,
<SYNC Start=296779><P>
it makes me want to avoid living with them after marrying
<SYNC Start=300267><P>
Well my parents don't want to live with me anyway
<SYNC Start=303230><P>
Aren't you forgetting something?
<SYNC Start=305054><P>
After marrying, it's not just your own parents
<SYNC Start=307381><P>
You now have the in-laws too
<SYNC Start=309159><P>
Ah that's true
<SYNC Start=310541><P>
When you get married, the number of parents and relatives,
<SYNC Start=314002><P>
even by simple math doubles
<SYNC Start=316194><P>
It's bad enough putting up with your own parents
<SYNC Start=318445><P>
I think it would be nice to play a good daughter in-law
<SYNC Start=323121><P>
saying, "mother~"
<SYNC Start=325672><P>
You look like the type who will poison her in-law
<SYNC Start=328222><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=329382><P>
Let's stop chatting and talk about work
<SYNC Start=332216><P>
Ah sorry
<SYNC Start=333106><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=333233><P>
I can't seem to focus today
<SYNC Start=335759><P>
What?
<SYNC Start=337751><P>
I think it's summer fatigue
<SYNC Start=339184><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=341937><P>
Suffering from summer fatigue?
<SYNC Start=343862><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=344874><P>
Yes
<SYNC Start=346408><P>
Me too
<SYNC Start=347513><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=348547><P>
I feel tired and have no energy
<SYNC Start=353241><P>
This is the first time I've seen a doctor describe her own symptom to a patient
<SYNC Start=355837><P>
Anybody can suffer from summer fatigue
<SYNC Start=359641><P>
Having a good routine,
sleeping, eating properly...
<SYNC Start=363266><P>
and drinking regularly...
<SYNC Start=364801><P>
is the only way to beat it
<SYNC Start=367620><P>
- I'm already doing that<br>
- Please continue to do it
<SYNC Start=370213><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=370945><P>
Doctor is powerless, huh
<SYNC Start=373232><P>
Are you incapable of not saying asinine things when you're being examined?
<SYNC Start=377265><P>
I see you still have energy left to get angry
<SYNC Start=379877><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=381049><P>
I need to recharge before the next patient so please...
<SYNC Start=385821><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=386341><P>
Looks like I got worse after coming here
<SYNC Start=389904><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=397002><P>
Excuse me<br>
Isn't it a bit hot in here?
<SYNC Start=399813><P>
I'm sorry
<SYNC Start=401101><P>
Somebody said it's too cold...
<SYNC Start=403767><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=404393><P>
- You<br>
- Yes
<SYNC Start=405475><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=406014><P>
I thought I asked to raise the temperature...
<SYNC Start=409872><P>
I did raise it...
<SYNC Start=411577><P>
I'm cold
<SYNC Start=412988><P>
Other say it's hot...
<SYNC Start=415341><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=417400><P>
Nevermind
<SYNC Start=418636><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=419673><P>
OK
<SYNC Start=421045><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=450734><P>
Please
<SYNC Start=451326><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=463718><P>
What are you doing here?
<SYNC Start=465635><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=466128><P>
I have something to tell you
<SYNC Start=468374><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=469015><P>
I'm busy
<SYNC Start=470530><P>
Don't you have a moment to talk?
<SYNC Start=473313><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=478757><P>
No
<SYNC Start=479725><P>
- Please come in<br>
- Huh?
<SYNC Start=481348><P>
There's a problem with the diagnosis
<SYNC Start=483984><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=484718><P>
I'll explain it to you
<SYNC Start=486302><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=486989><P>
Please come this way
<SYNC Start=488177><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=492009><P>
I'm sorry
<SYNC Start=493315><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=493798><P>
Who is that?
<SYNC Start=495021><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=496064><P>
It's my Dad.<br>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=497450><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=524029><P>
Please take care of yourself
<SYNC Start=526327><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=526926><P>
Thank you
<SYNC Start=527965><P>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=655906><P>
You put in the desired budget this morning right?
<SYNC Start=658163><P>
Yes
<SYNC Start=658886><P>
They decided to have separate entrances
<SYNC Start=661985><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=662867><P>
I don't know what to do...
<SYNC Start=666091><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=676014><P>
Kaneda updated his site
<SYNC Start=677823><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=684089><P>
At the bar I frequent<br>
I tried a new cocktail
<SYNC Start=688174><P>
As usual, goofing around and not working
<SYNC Start=690202><P>
I guess he's got nothing to worry about
<SYNC Start=691917><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=692483><P>
I'm going to the bathroom
<SYNC Start=693767><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=699144><P>
Kaneda-san's homepage?
<SYNC Start=700779><P>
Yup
<SYNC Start=701349><P>
I'm looking at it now
<SYNC Start=702473><P>
You see the lady's hand in the photo?
<SYNC Start=704565><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=709276><P>
Eh?
<SYNC Start=710486><P>
That bracelet...
<SYNC Start=712183><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=714049><P>
What are you looking at?
<SYNC Start=715423><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=724232><P>
Mmm...
<SYNC Start=725636><P>
We only met once!
<SYNC Start=728644><P>
I don't care if it is Kaneda
<SYNC Start=730798><P>
I'm more curious why you didn't tell me about it
<SYNC Start=734321><P>
Well let's drop this now
<SYNC Start=736111><P>
You're the one who ratted me out!
<SYNC Start=739253><P>
Hey
<SYNC Start=739987><P>
Can I ask you something?
<SYNC Start=742042><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=742875><P>
This guy...
<SYNC Start=743785><P>
said he won't live with my parents if we get married
<SYNC Start=747467><P>
Wha.. you guy's are getting married?
<SYNC Start=749393><P>
No
<SYNC Start=750345><P>
What's the point of this if we're not marrying?
<SYNC Start=752987><P>
Marrying, not marrying is not the point.<br>
It's the way you think.
<SYNC Start=755978><P>
I'm a bit surprised by it
<SYNC Start=757569><P>
Me too
<SYNC Start=758595><P>
If my boyfriend told me he doesn't want to live with my parents<br>
that would be depressing
<SYNC Start=763329><P>
Let me ask this
<SYNC Start=764308><P>
Are you willing to live with your husband's Mom?
<SYNC Start=766832><P>
I pass~
<SYNC Start=767890><P>
I don't want to get nagged by Mother in-law
<SYNC Start=770216><P>
It depends on the person
<SYNC Start=771291><P>
If my husband-to-be is a proper person,
<SYNC Start=773448><P>
then his mother has to be one too, no?
<SYNC Start=776438><P>
I don't see any problem living together in that case
<SYNC Start=778738><P>
Well said~
<SYNC Start=779977><P>
You're talking about ideal
<SYNC Start=781624><P>
Who cares~  It's not going to happen for awhile anyway
<SYNC Start=784980><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=800697><P>
Excuse me
<SYNC Start=801359><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=818519><P>
Sorry
<SYNC Start=819381><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=820315><P>
This too
<SYNC Start=821234><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=851126><P>
What's going on?
<SYNC Start=853003><P>
Sorry,
<SYNC Start=854067><P>
Don't ask why, but can I stay here tonight?
<SYNC Start=856710><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=857165><P>
Sure you can but...
<SYNC Start=859040><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=863206><P>
Why are you avoiding your father?
<SYNC Start=866488><P>
He probably wants me to go on omiai (date)
<SYNC Start=869451><P>
He says it looks bad to stay single past 35<br>
so he's always nagging
<SYNC Start=875309><P>
So why not just go on omiai?
<SYNC Start=877905><P>
I want to go on one too...
<SYNC Start=881060><P>
I never liked any news father came to tell me
<SYNC Start=884149><P>
Saying stuff like how sincerity is the sole best quality,
<SYNC Start=888848><P>
and...
<SYNC Start=889356><P>
that wives should be stay-at-home Mom
<SYNC Start=893812><P>
Must have old view of marriage
<SYNC Start=895904><P>
He says how a relative gave birth to two kids,
<SYNC Start=898966><P>
and how that's being a better daughter to him
<SYNC Start=902996><P>
Well all parents say stuff like that
<SYNC Start=906643><P>
My Mom passed away 3 years ago
<SYNC Start=909445><P>
Really?
<SYNC Start=911038><P>
Since losing her, he has become more stubborn and nosy
<SYNC Start=916545><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=940700><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=941352><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=943158><P>
-Ah, from the hospital....<br>
-No, you're mistaken
<SYNC Start=946839><P>
No, it's you!
<SYNC Start=948208><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=949583><P>
Ah.. yeah yeah...
<SYNC Start=951406><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=952096><P>
You shouldn't drink alcohol
<SYNC Start=954168><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=955843><P>
Why do you say that...
<SYNC Start=957193><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=957964><P>
You have an illness
<SYNC Start=959872><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=960358><P>
Ah~
<SYNC Start=961228><P>
I don't mean to be nosy<br>
but what illness do you have?
<SYNC Start=964544><P>
It's none of your business
<SYNC Start=965949><P>
It's not
<SYNC Start=967290><P>
But I can't let a sick person drink
<SYNC Start=971936><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=994031><P>
- Do you need a spoon?<br>
- No
<SYNC Start=997054><P>
- Do you have a point card?<br>
- No
<SYNC Start=998615><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1011567><P>
Eh?
<SYNC Start=1012593><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1016307><P>
I'll just tell you the truth
<SYNC Start=1018627><P>
You know,
<SYNC Start=1019654><P>
I was in the hopsital for just summer fatigue,
<SYNC Start=1021768><P>
and ran into your daughter,
<SYNC Start=1023875><P>
and just went along with her story
<SYNC Start=1027034><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1027619><P>
What's your relationship with Natsumi?
<SYNC Start=1030191><P>
There's no relationship
<SYNC Start=1031953><P>
If there's nothing between you two,
<SYNC Start=1033438><P>
how come you lied for her?
<SYNC Start=1036155><P>
We just happened to know each other
<SYNC Start=1037912><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1041568><P>
Excuse me
<SYNC Start=1042706><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1052855><P>
Eh?
<SYNC Start=1053384><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1055191><P>
What now?
<SYNC Start=1056273><P>
I have a favor to ask
<SYNC Start=1058007><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=1058908><P>
Would you please listen to me?
<SYNC Start=1060900><P>
I'm kind of busy
<SYNC Start=1061909><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1070731><P>
What's this?
<SYNC Start=1071751><P>
It's a volume mascara
<SYNC Start=1073621><P>
Ah~ so this is what people use~
<SYNC Start=1075975><P>
It's popular among young people
<SYNC Start=1078098><P>
Mmm~ young people huh
<SYNC Start=1081174><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1090518><P>
Hello?
<SYNC Start=1091616><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1092459><P>
Hello
<SYNC Start=1093616><P>
Good morning
<SYNC Start=1094973><P>
Something wrong?
<SYNC Start=1095988><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1096863><P>
Umm...
<SYNC Start=1098785><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1100806><P>
Can we meet today?
<SYNC Start=1103800><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=1104813><P>
With me?
<SYNC Start=1106417><P>
Well yes
<SYNC Start=1107649><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1108337><P>
What for?
<SYNC Start=1109785><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1110634><P>
Do we need a reason to meet?
<SYNC Start=1112488><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1113252><P>
Eh?
<SYNC Start=1114115><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1114602><P>
I really need to see you
<SYNC Start=1117252><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1121962><P>
Ok
<SYNC Start=1123223><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1124327><P>
Ok
<SYNC Start=1125306><P>
Bye
<SYNC Start=1126470><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1129648><P>
What's wrong?
<SYNC Start=1130976><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1131281><P>
No, it's nothing
<SYNC Start=1132750><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1142555><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=1143063><P>
- Good morning<br>
- Good morning
<SYNC Start=1145156><P>
That's where you were?
<SYNC Start=1146937><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1147648><P>
Well, I meet you at "A to Z" cafe
<SYNC Start=1151706><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1153944><P>
Wha~
<SYNC Start=1155456><P>
Was that call from Kuwano-san?
<SYNC Start=1157640><P>
Yup
<SYNC Start=1158325><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1159034><P>
That wasn't anything to hide about...
<SYNC Start=1161127><P>
I wasn't really hiding
<SYNC Start=1162911><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1163649><P>
You're meeting him?
<SYNC Start=1165315><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1165730><P>
For some reason, he wants to see me
<SYNC Start=1167517><P>
Is it a date?
<SYNC Start=1169132><P>
Probably not?
<SYNC Start=1170774><P>
But he looked kind of awkward
<SYNC Start=1173410><P>
What if he proposes to you?
<SYNC Start=1175667><P>
No way
<SYNC Start=1177988><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1189264><P>
Doctor
<SYNC Start=1189951><P>
Lentocan seems finished.  Should I bring it here?
<SYNC Start=1192372><P>
Yup, sure
<SYNC Start=1193425><P>
Ok
<SYNC Start=1193996><P>
Ah sorry
<SYNC Start=1195936><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1196396><P>
I'll be out until the afternoon patients
<SYNC Start=1199123><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=1199816><P>
Something going on?
<SYNC Start=1200850><P>
Is it a date?
<SYNC Start=1202955><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=1204975><P>
What are you talk about...
<SYNC Start=1206004><P>
It's not
<SYNC Start=1207799><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1208580><P>
Ouch
<SYNC Start=1208938><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1236668><P>
Excuse me
<SYNC Start=1237745><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1238360><P>
Hello
<SYNC Start=1239397><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1239764><P>
Hello
<SYNC Start=1240301><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1244009><P>
Would you like to order?
<SYNC Start=1245594><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1246155><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=1246592><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1248473><P>
Ice royal milk tea please
<SYNC Start=1250663><P>
Ok
<SYNC Start=1251807><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1256122><P>
Ah that's right,
<SYNC Start=1257152><P>
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday
<SYNC Start=1260346><P>
No problem
<SYNC Start=1260985><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1262279><P>
Umm...
<SYNC Start=1263207><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1270254><P>
Why are you avoiding your father?
<SYNC Start=1273434><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1274306><P>
He probably wants me to go on omiai
<SYNC Start=1277309><P>
Nothing wrong with that...
<SYNC Start=1279333><P>
you being your age and all
<SYNC Start=1281203><P>
It's still better that there's talk of omiai than nothing
<SYNC Start=1283442><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1283883><P>
I don't want to hear that from you
<SYNC Start=1285859><P>
You being the only daughter,
<SYNC Start=1288020><P>
I think it would be nice to show him his grand kid's face
<SYNC Start=1292904><P>
And also,
<SYNC Start=1294037><P>
you shouldn't complain even if the prospect has preivous marriage experience
<SYNC Start=1296987><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1299312><P>
You brought me out here to tell me that?
<SYNC Start=1301634><P>
Your late mother,
<SYNC Start=1303053><P>
is probably very worried too
<SYNC Start=1305341><P>
I told you my Mom passed away?
<SYNC Start=1309588><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1311434><P>
I told him that
<SYNC Start=1312836><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1316628><P>
Since you didn't want to listen to me,
<SYNC Start=1319827><P>
I asked him to bring you out here
<SYNC Start=1323578><P>
How did you two end up conspiring?
<SYNC Start=1326123><P>
We never conspired
<SYNC Start=1328265><P>
This guy was so persistent,
<SYNC Start=1331339><P>
so I gave in and cooperated
<SYNC Start=1333769><P>
What a way to put it...
<SYNC Start=1337552><P>
But that's the truth
<SYNC Start=1339249><P>
But for someone so reluctant,
<SYNC Start=1341070><P>
you did a great job telling her everything on my behalf
<SYNC Start=1346191><P>
Well I just told what I heard
<SYNC Start=1348648><P>
It didn't have to be this complicated...
<SYNC Start=1351908><P>
You came here to talk about marriage
<SYNC Start=1355621><P>
- Well yeah<br>
- Forget it
<SYNC Start=1359033><P>
Sorry for being a bad daughter
<SYNC Start=1360626><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1361458><P>
Is this how you treat other people too?
<SYNC Start=1364413><P>
Yes
<SYNC Start=1365518><P>
No, I only do it to you two
<SYNC Start=1368643><P>
Well then,
<SYNC Start=1371543><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1373087><P>
- I'll express my gratitude later...<br>
- Don't worry about it
<SYNC Start=1375284><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1378199><P>
Please cancel that
<SYNC Start=1379530><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1380629><P>
Always meddling...
<SYNC Start=1383768><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1387653><P>
Bye
<SYNC Start=1388240><P>
Why don't you want to listen to me?
<SYNC Start=1391266><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1393240><P>
Ok I'll listen,<br>
but hurry up
<SYNC Start=1396094><P>
Is that the attitude for listening to a father?
<SYNC Start=1399780><P>
What kind of person are you going to set me up with?
<SYNC Start=1401564><P>
You always like the government workers anyway
<SYNC Start=1404059><P>
Always the same type
<SYNC Start=1405518><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1412394><P>
Forget it
<SYNC Start=1413478><P>
Just go
<SYNC Start=1414407><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1415605><P>
Oh really?
<SYNC Start=1416306><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1417957><P>
Excuse me
<SYNC Start=1418704><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1435452><P>
Kaneda?
<SYNC Start=1436245><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1453194><P>
Natsumi won't listen to me
<SYNC Start=1456139><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1457230><P>
Is that so
<SYNC Start=1458491><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1470829><P>
What more now?
<SYNC Start=1472277><P>
Hotel is this way
<SYNC Start=1474136><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1474565><P>
Well I'm going this way
<SYNC Start=1475902><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1476346><P>
Won't you at least listen to me?
<SYNC Start=1478522><P>
...about what I want to tell Natsumi?
<SYNC Start=1481546><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1484560><P>
Why me...
<SYNC Start=1486333><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1486871><P>
It won't hurt to listen!
<SYNC Start=1489270><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1490509><P>
I guess
<SYNC Start=1492207><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1495207><P>
But
<SYNC Start=1496599><P>
I want to tell Natsumi myself
<SYNC Start=1499506><P>
Please make sure you don't slip your tongue
<SYNC Start=1504061><P>
Don't worry,
<SYNC Start=1505505><P>
I never talk to her anyway
<SYNC Start=1508301><P>
Never?
<SYNC Start=1509400><P>
Yes
<SYNC Start=1509975><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1519681><P>
What's this~
<SYNC Start=1520468><P>
this isn't a date~
<SYNC Start=1522737><P>
Sorry for letting you down~
<SYNC Start=1525080><P>
But why is Kuwano-san listening to your father's concerns?
<SYNC Start=1528266><P>
He's twisted and timid,
<SYNC Start=1530135><P>
so he caves into anybody more stubborn than him
<SYNC Start=1533262><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1538068><P>
Ah!
<SYNC Start=1539894><P>
Drinking beer by himself!
<SYNC Start=1541995><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1575487><P>
Hello?
<SYNC Start=1576058><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1576723><P>
Why don't you come over here?
<SYNC Start=1578462><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=1579044><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1579556><P>
Left, left
<SYNC Start=1581964><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1588071><P>
Nah forget it
<SYNC Start=1589206><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1591241><P>
If you sit there by yourself...
<SYNC Start=1593744><P>
I won't be able to enjoy myself
<SYNC Start=1596122><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1599619><P>
What a total disaster that was,
being caught in between their fight
<SYNC Start=1603865><P>
Things got worse thanks to somebody...
<SYNC Start=1607905><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1608507><P>
Like father like daughter huh
<SYNC Start=1611609><P>
So what did your father want to tell you?
<SYNC Start=1614805><P>
It's about omiai
<SYNC Start=1616533><P>
You're wrong
<SYNC Start=1617323><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=1617941><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1619025><P>
He told you something?
<SYNC Start=1620647><P>
Well yeah
<SYNC Start=1621802><P>
Well then you should say it
<SYNC Start=1623966><P>
He wants to tell her directly
<SYNC Start=1626038><P>
Why are you being loyal to him anyway?
<SYNC Start=1629364><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1630848><P>
He just wants to side with my opponent
<SYNC Start=1634842><P>
Ah~
<SYNC Start=1636806><P>
But I was so surprised,
<SYNC Start=1638996><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1640139><P>
To think that her father had such secret
<SYNC Start=1643866><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1644367><P>
Stop egging us on and just tell us!
<SYNC Start=1646875><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1647356><P>
It's secret!
<SYNC Start=1648110><P>
Why is that?
<SYNC Start=1649610><P>
Forget it!
<SYNC Start=1651223><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1651758><P>
So you get into this kind of argument everyday<br>
when you get married huh
<SYNC Start=1655283><P>
No one is going to marry you!
<SYNC Start=1657520><P>
I'm talking in general
<SYNC Start=1658798><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1659764><P>
I don't think this happens in general...
<SYNC Start=1662675><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1672261><P>
- Waited long?<br>
- Yep
<SYNC Start=1673808><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1674982><P>
You look great today
<SYNC Start=1676778><P>
Really?
<SYNC Start=1678110><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1679507><P>
You look great too
<SYNC Start=1680685><P>
Thank you
<SYNC Start=1681537><P>
Welcome
<SYNC Start=1682378><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1683262><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=1684030><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1684380><P>
Hello
<SYNC Start=1685259><P>
Yes 
<SYNC Start=1686415><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1696784><P>
I'll have the usual... double!
<SYNC Start=1698130><P>
Hey
<SYNC Start=1698887><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1699331><P>
Do you want to meet my parents?
<SYNC Start=1701753><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1702465><P>
Isn't it a bit early?
<SYNC Start=1705343><P>
I want to introduce you to my Dad
<SYNC Start=1708184><P>
No?
<SYNC Start=1708869><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1711026><P>
He wants to build a house with high ceiling~..
<SYNC Start=1714675><P>
I want to meet him
<SYNC Start=1716228><P>
Really?
<SYNC Start=1716936><P>
I'm so happy~
<SYNC Start=1718393><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1724291><P>
Ah you're finally here
<SYNC Start=1726024><P>
Please wait a minute
<SYNC Start=1727704><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1728080><P>
What?
<SYNC Start=1728634><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1734375><P>
I bought this on my way home
<SYNC Start=1736053><P>
I didn't think I can finish them
<SYNC Start=1738180><P>
But why me?
<SYNC Start=1739636><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1739956><P>
No special meaning
<SYNC Start=1741511><P>
I was buying mine anyway
<SYNC Start=1743370><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1751440><P>
Well in return, can you tell me what Natsumi-san's father said?
<SYNC Start=1757741><P>
No
<SYNC Start=1758596><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1765039><P>
If you make two entrances, the parents' kitchen will get too dark
<SYNC Start=1768482><P>
You're right
<SYNC Start=1770163><P>
What about we move it upstair?
<SYNC Start=1772242><P>
No
<SYNC Start=1773025><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1773573><P>
Sorry
<SYNC Start=1775032><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1775760><P>
That client from the other day<br>
the father is fighting back
<SYNC Start=1779234><P>
So I guess he wants only one entrance?
<SYNC Start=1780692><P>
That's right
<SYNC Start=1781537><P>
In the end, the parents hold the purse string
<SYNC Start=1784406><P>
Until they decide, can you the stop the work?
<SYNC Start=1787320><P>
But I was working on it...
<SYNC Start=1788315><P>
Sorry, I'll make some coffee~
<SYNC Start=1791286><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1792543><P>
There's a bon odori (Bon festival) at Mariama Center tonight
<SYNC Start=1795148><P>
I hear there will be street vendors
<SYNC Start=1796898><P>
Since you have time, why don't you go?
<SYNC Start=1799415><P>
Boring~
<SYNC Start=1800588><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1805045><P>
Kuwano-san didn't tell me after all
<SYNC Start=1807968><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1808754><P>
It's ok.  Just drop it.
<SYNC Start=1810697><P>
Doesn't it bother you?
<SYNC Start=1812523><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1813617><P>
If my Dad changes his old ways,
<SYNC Start=1816541><P>
then maybe I'll listen to him
<SYNC Start=1818199><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1818885><P>
Your Dad sounds like a diffcult character...
<SYNC Start=1822842><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1823354><P>
Why can't men like Dad and Kuwano-san be honest?
<SYNC Start=1827921><P>
Isn't that too small a sample?
<SYNC Start=1831868><P>
That's true
<SYNC Start=1833103><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1836529><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=1837547><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1839191><P>
Sample no. 2
<SYNC Start=1841173><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=1841660><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1842660><P>
He's catching goldfish by himself...
<SYNC Start=1845495><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1846189><P>
Is he going to raise them?
<SYNC Start=1848568><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1851473><P>
Ah~
<SYNC Start=1853116><P>
That's too bad
<SYNC Start=1854817><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1855530><P>
That's not going to work
<SYNC Start=1857103><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1857799><P>
Sir, one more
<SYNC Start=1859176><P>
Ok
<SYNC Start=1859898><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1860666><P>
Here
<SYNC Start=1861202><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1862343><P>
First you have to check the front,
<SYNC Start=1864330><P>
and make sure the glued side faces up
<SYNC Start=1866951><P>
If not, then the water will collect and rip
<SYNC Start=1870438><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1870899><P>
Then get close...
<SYNC Start=1875208><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1876349><P>
Pick a target, and put the net in angle
<SYNC Start=1880933><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1882149><P>
As you zone in on the fish,<br>
you put the net underneath
<SYNC Start=1885407><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1886587><P>
The important thing is<br>
not to move clumsily
<SYNC Start=1890177><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1891990><P>
The problem begins here
<SYNC Start=1893335><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1895048><P>
You have to control the fish and water,
<SYNC Start=1897957><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1899113><P>
so the movement of the fish doesn't rip the net
<SYNC Start=1901434><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1902151><P>
And put the fish on the net
<SYNC Start=1905896><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1907707><P>
I did it!
<SYNC Start=1908633><P>
Thank you sir!
<SYNC Start=1910314><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1918212><P>
Ah that's too bad...
<SYNC Start=1920221><P>
One more
<SYNC Start=1920872><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1921958><P>
You came last year too right?
<SYNC Start=1924149><P>
This one's on me
<SYNC Start=1925742><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1928456><P>
Good luck!
<SYNC Start=1929647><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1935664><P>
Shall we go?
<SYNC Start=1937005><P>
Let's go
<SYNC Start=1937880><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1956781><P>
Can I just buy it?
<SYNC Start=1958297><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1963166><P>
Welcome~  How many?
<SYNC Start=1965555><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1997048><P>
Welcome
<SYNC Start=1998361><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1998783><P>
I'll have the usual
<SYNC Start=2000538><P>
Ok
<SYNC Start=2002319><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2014683><P>
- Welcome<br>
- Six people
<SYNC Start=2017421><P>
Ah.. well...
<SYNC Start=2020507><P>
We have seats here and there, separated...
<SYNC Start=2025469><P>
It's separate tables...
<SYNC Start=2026911><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2032910><P>
Shall we go somewhere else?
<SYNC Start=2034166><P>
I'm sorry
<SYNC Start=2035703><P>
Let's go
<SYNC Start=2036721><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2054599><P>
Hello
<SYNC Start=2055488><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2055824><P>
What now?
<SYNC Start=2057150><P>
No,
<SYNC Start=2057572><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2058137><P>
I don't have any
<SYNC Start=2059399><P>
I just wanted to,
<SYNC Start=2061657><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2062101><P>
give this to Natsumi
<SYNC Start=2064494><P>
But with what happened and all,
<SYNC Start=2066602><P>
I'd like you to have it
<SYNC Start=2068431><P>
I don't have any reason to accept it
<SYNC Start=2070547><P>
I came here just to give it to you
<SYNC Start=2073277><P>
just-to-give-it to you
<SYNC Start=2076210><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2083118><P>
Would you mind waiting a moment?
<SYNC Start=2086790><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2109201><P>
As a return...
<SYNC Start=2110220><P>
Ah.. what's this?
<SYNC Start=2112745><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2113455><P>
They're meat-filled buns
<SYNC Start=2114852><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2116486><P>
Here
<SYNC Start=2117563><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2118018><P>
Ah...
<SYNC Start=2118774><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2120240><P>
I can't eat all these
<SYNC Start=2122349><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2124488><P>
Then I'll have one
<SYNC Start=2126869><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2127695><P>
Ok

<SYNC Start=2150295><P>
Did you tell it to Natsumi?
<SYNC Start=2154149><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2154827><P>
I didn't
<SYNC Start=2156107><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2156491><P>
Eh, why not?
<SYNC Start=2157781><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2158499><P>
You told me not to
<SYNC Start=2159924><P>
But people tell anyway
<SYNC Start=2162962><P>
What are you talking about
<SYNC Start=2164828><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2166264><P>
Fine,
<SYNC Start=2167480><P>
I'll tell her
<SYNC Start=2168702><P>
You don't need to tell!
<SYNC Start=2170507><P>
I don't understand
<SYNC Start=2172374><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2174583><P>
Ah!
<SYNC Start=2175438><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2176279><P>
Michiru you are so fast!
<SYNC Start=2178472><P>
Fast, really?
<SYNC Start=2179808><P>
I am pretty good
<SYNC Start=2181390><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2183736><P>
well that's that
<SYNC Start=2184718><P>
I'm leaving
<SYNC Start=2186176><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2186849><P>
Is that ok really?
<SYNC Start=2188135><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2190706><P>
Ah, Kuwano-san
<SYNC Start=2192422><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=2193206><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2194509><P>
Ah you caught one
<SYNC Start=2196268><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2197876><P>
It's so cute
<SYNC Start=2199266><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2202368><P>
Please go catch one more
<SYNC Start=2205180><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=2206112><P>
He's going to be lonely
<SYNC Start=2208248><P>
He'll want a partner
<SYNC Start=2211276><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2211932><P>
You don't understand the trouble I went through to catch just one
<SYNC Start=2214836><P>
It's for his sake
<SYNC Start=2216744><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2227549><P>
Did you throw up?
<SYNC Start=2228928><P>
Yes
<SYNC Start=2229650><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2231458><P>
It's a mild food poisoning
<SYNC Start=2233679><P>
Nothing major
<SYNC Start=2235361><P>
Food poisoning?
<SYNC Start=2236864><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2237381><P>
What did you eat?
<SYNC Start=2239201><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2239906><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=2240527><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2241058><P>
Did you eat something weird at that restaurant?
<SYNC Start=2243205><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2243707><P>
No I didn't
<SYNC Start=2244889><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2245989><P>
Last night I had steaks..
<SYNC Start=2248350><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=2248892><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2250061><P>
What is it?
<SYNC Start=2251728><P>
I ate the meat-filled buns from the neighbor
<SYNC Start=2254704><P>
but it hadn't been in the fridge
<SYNC Start=2256715><P>
That's no good, if you don't keep them in fridge in this weather
<SYNC Start=2260272><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2260918><P>
Well I'll prescribe you some medicine
<SYNC Start=2262944><P>
Thank you very much
<SYNC Start=2263618><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2266961><P>
Ah
<SYNC Start=2267436><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2268505><P>
What is it?
<SYNC Start=2269059><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2271283><P>
Your father ate it too
<SYNC Start=2273061><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2274190><P>
By now, he's probably...
<SYNC Start=2277454><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2282568><P>
Well, I don't care
<SYNC Start=2284418><P>
Really? 
<SYNC Start=2285695><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2286013><P>
Well then
<SYNC Start=2286566><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2287542><P>
Please wait a minute
<SYNC Start=2289252><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2301641><P>
He's not picking his cell
<SYNC Start=2303702><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2304250><P>
If he's sick, he'll come to the hospital
<SYNC Start=2307435><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2308319><P>
I guess so
<SYNC Start=2309545><P>
Ah there were 3 left<br>
I wonder if he ate them all...
<SYNC Start=2313428><P>
Huh?!
<SYNC Start=2314316><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2314933><P>
Bye
<SYNC Start=2315531><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2318860><P>
Where is he stayng?
<SYNC Start=2320423><P>
Um... I did hear the hotel name...
<SYNC Start=2324223><P>
Try to remember it
<SYNC Start=2325639><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2326159><P>
But,
<SYNC Start=2327315><P>
I thought you didn't care?
<SYNC Start=2328682><P>
Enough!
<SYNC Start=2329586><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2331991><P>
Edward hotel
<SYNC Start=2333111><P>
Edward hotel huh
<SYNC Start=2334864><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2335621><P>
Was it Adrian hotel?<br>
No, that's from Rocky
<SYNC Start=2339045><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2340926><P>
Victoria?
<SYNC Start=2342013><P>
I think it was some aristocratic name...
<SYNC Start=2344503><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2345080><P>
Renoir... maybe that's a cafe?
<SYNC Start=2346941><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2353130><P>
Ouch
<SYNC Start=2353596><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2355601><P>
This way
<SYNC Start=2356489><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2363894><P>
Yes?
<SYNC Start=2364405><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2366079><P>
Doctor call
<SYNC Start=2367359><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2371121><P>
I did feel sick since the morning, but not enough to warrant a doctor call
<SYNC Start=2375638><P>
Well just lie down
<SYNC Start=2377972><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2389708><P>
You gave me weird stuff...
<SYNC Start=2391756><P>
I never said to eat them all
<SYNC Start=2393575><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2394338><P>
It's food poisoning
<SYNC Start=2396437><P>
Please eat something light for awhile
<SYNC Start=2400243><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2413490><P>
I guess you're a doctor after all
<SYNC Start=2415044><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2416599><P>
Of course
<SYNC Start=2418528><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2425114><P>
What's this?
<SYNC Start=2425827><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2429133><P>
I don't even know if I'm going to get married or not
<SYNC Start=2432295><P>
You don't have to go this far!
<SYNC Start=2435541><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2436242><P>
Who said anything about YOUR wedding?
<SYNC Start=2439682><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2440210><P>
Huh?
<SYNC Start=2440752><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2444867><P>
It's MY wedding
<SYNC Start=2447016><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2448602><P>
Yours?
<SYNC Start=2450362><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2453566><P>
I met her from the hiking club
<SYNC Start=2456859><P>
She's a good person
<SYNC Start=2458820><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2464509><P>
Well you should've told me....
<SYNC Start=2467868><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2468328><P>
I wanted to tell you,
<SYNC Start=2470265><P>
and get your approval
<SYNC Start=2472436><P>
But you...
<SYNC Start=2474446><P>
But you did really say... 
<SYNC Start=2476476><P>
Because you weren't willing to listen!
<SYNC Start=2479174><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2493644><P>
Congratulations
<SYNC Start=2494552><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2503271><P>
Can I go to the wedding?
<SYNC Start=2506051><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2506549><P>
You silly
<SYNC Start=2507299><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2507908><P>
That goes without saying
<SYNC Start=2509425><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2511333><P>
I set the date on the 20th so you can come
<SYNC Start=2516337><P>
What?
<SYNC Start=2517066><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2518541><P>
How did you know I have off on the 20th?
<SYNC Start=2522166><P>
I heard it while I was at the hospital
<SYNC Start=2525355><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2530090><P>
Now only your wedding is left
<SYNC Start=2532725><P>
Here we go again...
<SYNC Start=2534537><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2535112><P>
Well, I'll get going
<SYNC Start=2537905><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2539040><P>
Kuwano-san,<br>
For your help this time,
<SYNC Start=2541671><P>
You thank him too
<SYNC Start=2542888><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2546084><P>
Thank you very much
<SYNC Start=2548240><P>
I hope you find a good person...
<SYNC Start=2551058><P>
Ah! 
<SYNC Start=2551845><P>
If it's ok, I can set up an omiai..
<SYNC Start=2554730><P>
No thank you
<SYNC Start=2556033><P>
Just because you're marrying,
<SYNC Start=2557675><P>
plase don't pull other people in too
<SYNC Start=2560131><P>
Bye
<SYNC Start=2561278><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2561960><P>
"Pull other people in" what the..
<SYNC Start=2565005><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2572790><P>
Mom and Dad's living space is in blue,
<SYNC Start=2574757><P>
and the son's family is in yellow
<SYNC Start=2578766><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2581032><P>
How about here?
<SYNC Start=2583420><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2583905><P>
That's livingroom and kitchen
<SYNC Start=2586316><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2586782><P>
Um...
<SYNC Start=2587831><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2588297><P>
Livingroom and kitchen will be shared from the both sides
<SYNC Start=2593319><P>
According to Kuwano-san,<br>
with the proposed budget,
<SYNC Start=2595785><P>
it wasn't enough to build two sets of kitchen and livingroom
<SYNC Start=2599753><P>
That's right
<SYNC Start=2601002><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2601702><P>
Besides, in the house,
<SYNC Start=2603361><P>
there should be a place where everbody can talk,
<SYNC Start=2605815><P>
and maybe even argue
<SYNC Start=2609293><P>
That's fine with us
<SYNC Start=2612306><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2613668><P>
Are we really short of budget?
<SYNC Start=2616336><P>
We're absolutely short
<SYNC Start=2617856><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2648854><P>
What is it??
<SYNC Start=2649716><P>
Today was Dad's wedding<br>
Here's a present
<SYNC Start=2653630><P>
He told me to give it to you
<SYNC Start=2656305><P>
It's probably going to be one of those useless plates
<SYNC Start=2658892><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2659353><P>
Bingo!
<SYNC Start=2660292><P>
Well it doesn't matter<br>
It's just a courtesy
<SYNC Start=2663651><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2666776><P>
But I don't understand...
<SYNC Start=2668743><P>
why he's marrying again
<SYNC Start=2671475><P>
She's a really great person
<SYNC Start=2673666><P>
I can understand why he'd want to marry
<SYNC Start=2676428><P>
Well at that age,
<SYNC Start=2677765><P>
you don't need to worry about the in-laws
<SYNC Start=2679390><P>
About that...
<SYNC Start=2680463><P>
her mother is very healthy
<SYNC Start=2682760><P>
At 87, she's still kicking!
<SYNC Start=2685157><P>
And she's really stubborn!
<SYNC Start=2688062><P>
So whoever marries you will end up with...
<SYNC Start=2691452><P>
a stubborn father in-law, a stubborn 87 year old grand mother
<SYNC Start=2695965><P>
I guess that's true
<SYNC Start=2696965><P>
Looks like it'll get harder for you to marry
<SYNC Start=2698545><P>
Totally unnecessary concern~
<SYNC Start=2700419><P>
Thank you
<SYNC Start=2701346><P>
Good night
<SYNC Start=2702830><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2707435><P>
Ah, you're here!
<SYNC Start=2708838><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2709604><P>
You know, I was thinking...
<SYNC Start=2713314><P>
About your father...
<SYNC Start=2715371><P>
Don't you think he and Kuwano-san are alike?
<SYNC Start=2718192><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2718999><P>
Mmm.. there are subtle differences...
<SYNC Start=2721634><P>
My Dad is stubborn<br>
Kuwano-san is just cynical
<SYNC Start=2724966><P>
Well they're both peculiar
<SYNC Start=2728181><P>
I think it's your fate to meet these people
<SYNC Start=2730622><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2731969><P>
I'm going to wait...
<SYNC Start=2733104><P>
to meet a normal person
<SYNC Start=2735428><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2760911><P>
See if you get married,
<SYNC Start=2763355><P>
you need to be alert,
<SYNC Start=2764809><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2765670><P>
the water gets dirtier,
<SYNC Start=2767690><P>
oxygen gets halved
<SYNC Start=2769756><P>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2770197><P>
It's better to be alone
<SYNC Start=2772446><P>
Right?
<SYNC Start=2773255><P>&nbsp;
