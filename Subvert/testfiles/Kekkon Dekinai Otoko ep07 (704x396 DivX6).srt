00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:12,339
Episode 7
What's wrong with hating family get-together?!

2
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:25,579


3
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,836
how do you tie this...

4
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:31,773


5
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:33,497
How to tie a tie

6
00:00:33,497 --> 00:01:01,631


7
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:03,341
Good morning

8
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,910


9
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,203
Wow you're wearing a tie!  How unusual!

10
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:09,884


11
00:01:09,884 --> 00:01:11,869
Today's the my father's "san kaiki" (3rd anniversary of death)

12
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:12,671


13
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:15,554
Why is it "san kaiki" even though he died 2 years ago?

14
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:16,051


15
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,003
Um...

16
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:19,757
Do you think that tie is ok?

17
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:21,244
What about it?

18
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:25,739
I think it's still black tie for "san kaiki"...

19
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,697


20
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:31,984
Sheesh, anniversary service is such a nuisance...

21
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:35,186


22
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:39,020
I say it nicely and not even a thanks

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,226


24
00:01:43,226 --> 00:01:46,565
For "san kaiki", black tie is appropriate

25
00:01:46,565 --> 00:02:03,421


26
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,958
Thank you for coming

27
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,934
- Don't mention it
- Here have some

28
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:11,226
Shinsuke, pour me a glass

29
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:15,632
- Um, even with your busy schedule, thank..
- You know Ikuyo-san...

30
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:19,892
Only Shinsuke needs to get married now

31
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:22,976
As the elder son, only you can continue on Kuwano's name

32
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,357
Your late father,

33
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:25,892


34
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:27,377
even on that night (he passed away),

35
00:02:27,377 --> 00:02:31,309
was worried about you

36
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:31,739


37
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:32,842
Well, yeah

38
00:02:32,842 --> 00:02:33,132


39
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:36,176
How about Yoshikawa's daughter?

40
00:02:36,176 --> 00:02:39,495
Her husband passed away last year

41
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:40,258


42
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:43,635
Fumi's husband is still alive and well!

43
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:45,652
But shinsuke...

44
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:51,002
you know you're not in a position turn away people with previous marriage experience

45
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,424
Yes I know

46
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:53,739
Don't worry it's ok!

47
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,660
Marriage happens by fate

48
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,604
All of a sudden,

49
00:02:56,604 --> 00:02:59,696
one day a good prospect can appear out of nowhere!

50
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:02,122
It would be nice if that was the case...

51
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:03,876
It's ok don't worry!

52
00:03:03,876 --> 00:03:08,014
Ikuyo-san, how about living with Shinsuke until then?

53
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:09,609
No thank you!

54
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,885
Not with this cold selfish guy

55
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:13,324
How about living with Keiko?

56
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:14,308


57
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:17,108
Well that would be 100 times better

58
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:17,584


59
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,293
Since Yumi is there too

60
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:22,084
That's right
I wish you'd live with us too

61
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,803
- Right, honey?
- Uh.. umm yeah.

62
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:29,751


63
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,666
Why do they always say the same thing every time we meet?

64
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:36,960
It's because you're making them.

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,348
Hey honey

66
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:41,332
- What kind of reaction was that?
- Hrmm what?

67
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:44,243
Your face changed
You don't want to live with her, right?

68
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:46,282
No that's not it

69
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:49,031


70
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:53,591
Don't worry
I have no plan to leave my current home

71
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,360
But you'll let me live in an ash vase in your house after I die, right?

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,910
Yes, by all means

73
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,510


74
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,998
I have work, so I'll get going

75
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:05,985
What?

76
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,688
You don't need a ride?

77
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:10,264
I want to get away from these people as soon as possible

78
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:10,979
Later

79
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,546


80
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,261
Even in an ash vase,

81
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:18,567
I don't want to live with him

82
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,105


83
00:04:20,105 --> 00:04:22,001
You're going to have separate entrances?

84
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,448
Of course

85
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,241
Even though it's a multi-family home,

86
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:27,297
we still need our prviacy

87
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:32,166
Why do you need two entrances for one house?

88
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:35,705
Inside, we can build a door that connects two units

89
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:40,062
Isn't it nice just that fact that we'll be living together

90
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:42,770


91
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,874
We run into this issue even at work

92
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:46,722
Today is an aging society,

93
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:49,646
so we'll be seeing more houses with 2 generations living together

94
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:52,712
Maybe we should build a ring inside so they can duke it out

95
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:55,347
Ring instead of a living (room) huh...

96
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:56,779
After seeing these,

97
00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:00,267
it makes me want to avoid living with them after marrying

98
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:03,230
Well my parents don't want to live with me anyway

99
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,054
Aren't you forgetting something?

100
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,381
After marrying, it's not just your own parents

101
00:05:07,381 --> 00:05:09,159
You now have the in-laws too

102
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:10,541
Ah that's true

103
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,002
When you get married, the number of parents and relatives,

104
00:05:14,002 --> 00:05:16,194
even by simple math doubles

105
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,445
It's bad enough putting up with your own parents

106
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:23,121
I think it would be nice to play a good daughter in-law

107
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:25,672
saying, "mother~"

108
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:28,222
You look like the type who will poison her in-law

109
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:29,382


110
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:32,216
Let's stop chatting and talk about work

111
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:33,106
Ah sorry

112
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:33,233


113
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,759
I can't seem to focus today

114
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,751
What?

115
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,184
I think it's summer fatigue

116
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:41,937


117
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:43,862
Suffering from summer fatigue?

118
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:44,874


119
00:05:44,874 --> 00:05:46,408
Yes

120
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:47,513
Me too

121
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,547
Huh?

122
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:53,241
I feel tired and have no energy

123
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,837
This is the first time I've seen a doctor describe her own symptom to a patient

124
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:59,641
Anybody can suffer from summer fatigue

125
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:03,266
Having a good routine,sleeping, eating properly...

126
00:06:03,266 --> 00:06:04,801
and drinking regularly...

127
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:07,620
is the only way to beat it

128
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,213
- I'm already doing that
- Please continue to do it

129
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:10,945


130
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:13,232
Doctor is powerless, huh

131
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:17,265
Are you incapable of not saying asinine things when you're being examined?

132
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,877
I see you still have energy left to get angry

133
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:21,049


134
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:25,821
I need to recharge before the next patient so please...

135
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:26,341


136
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:29,904
Looks like I got worse after coming here

137
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:37,002


138
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:39,813
Excuse me
Isn't it a bit hot in here?

139
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,101
I'm sorry

140
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,767
Somebody said it's too cold...

141
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:44,393


142
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:45,475
- You
- Yes

143
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:46,014


144
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:49,872
I thought I asked to raise the temperature...

145
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:51,577
I did raise it...

146
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,988
I'm cold

147
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:55,341
Other say it's hot...

148
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,400


149
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,636
Nevermind

150
00:06:58,636 --> 00:06:59,673


151
00:06:59,673 --> 00:07:01,045
OK

152
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:30,734


153
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:31,326
Please

154
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:43,718


155
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,635
What are you doing here?

156
00:07:45,635 --> 00:07:46,128


157
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:48,374
I have something to tell you

158
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:49,015


159
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:50,530
I'm busy

160
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,313
Don't you have a moment to talk?

161
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:58,757


162
00:07:58,757 --> 00:07:59,725
No

163
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,348
- Please come in
- Huh?

164
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,984
There's a problem with the diagnosis

165
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:04,718


166
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,302
I'll explain it to you

167
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:06,989


168
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,177
Please come this way

169
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:12,009


170
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,315
I'm sorry

171
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:13,798


172
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:15,021
Who is that?

173
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,064


174
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:17,450
It's my Dad.
Excuse me.

175
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:44,029


176
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:46,327
Please take care of yourself

177
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:46,926


178
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:47,965
Thank you

179
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:58,950


180
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,950
Kekkon Dekinai Otoko

181
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,950


182
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,950
Translation: InCyphe (-.,-);

183
00:09:07,950 --> 00:10:39,049


184
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:55,906


185
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,163
You put in the desired budget this morning right?

186
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:58,886
Yes

187
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:01,985
They decided to have separate entrances

188
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:02,867


189
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:06,091
I don't know what to do...

190
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:16,014


191
00:11:16,014 --> 00:11:17,823
Kaneda updated his site

192
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:24,089


193
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,174
At the bar I frequent
I tried a new cocktail

194
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:30,202
As usual, goofing around and not working

195
00:11:30,202 --> 00:11:31,917
I guess he's got nothing to worry about

196
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:32,483


197
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,767
I'm going to the bathroom

198
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:39,144


199
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,779
Kaneda-san's homepage?

200
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:41,349
Yup

201
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:42,473
I'm looking at it now

202
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:44,565
You see the lady's hand in the photo?

203
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:49,276


204
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,486
Eh?

205
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,183
That bracelet...

206
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:54,049


207
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:55,423
What are you looking at?

208
00:11:55,423 --> 00:12:04,232


209
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:05,636
Mmm...

210
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:08,644
We only met once!

211
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,798
I don't care if it is Kaneda

212
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:14,321
I'm more curious why you didn't tell me about it

213
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,111
Well let's drop this now

214
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,253
You're the one who ratted me out!

215
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:19,987
Hey

216
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:22,042
Can I ask you something?

217
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:22,875


218
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,785
This guy...

219
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:27,467
said he won't live with my parents if we get married

220
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,393
Wha.. you guy's are getting married?

221
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:30,345
No

222
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,987
What's the point of this if we're not marrying?

223
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:35,978
Marrying, not marrying is not the point.
It's the way you think.

224
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:37,569
I'm a bit surprised by it

225
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:38,595
Me too

226
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:43,329
If my boyfriend told me he doesn't want to live with my parents
that would be depressing

227
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,308
Let me ask this

228
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:46,832
Are you willing to live with your husband's Mom?

229
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:47,890
I pass~

230
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,216
I don't want to get nagged by Mother in-law

231
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,291
It depends on the person

232
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,448
If my husband-to-be is a proper person,

233
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:56,438
then his mother has to be one too, no?

234
00:12:56,438 --> 00:12:58,738
I don't see any problem living together in that case

235
00:12:58,738 --> 00:12:59,977
Well said~

236
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,624
You're talking about ideal

237
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:04,980
Who cares~  It's not going to happen for awhile anyway

238
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:20,697


239
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:21,359
Excuse me

240
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:38,519


241
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,381
Sorry

242
00:13:39,381 --> 00:13:40,315


243
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:41,234
This too

244
00:13:41,234 --> 00:14:11,126


245
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,003
What's going on?

246
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:14,067
Sorry,

247
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:16,710
Don't ask why, but can I stay here tonight?

248
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,165


249
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:19,040
Sure you can but...

250
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,206


251
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:26,488
Why are you avoiding your father?

252
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:29,451
He probably wants me to go on omiai (date)

253
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:35,309
He says it looks bad to stay single past 35
so he's always nagging

254
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,905
So why not just go on omiai?

255
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:41,060
I want to go on one too...

256
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,149
I never liked any news father came to tell me

257
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,848
Saying stuff like how sincerity is the sole best quality,

258
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:49,356
and...

259
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:53,812
that wives should be stay-at-home Mom

260
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,904
Must have old view of marriage

261
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,966
He says how a relative gave birth to two kids,

262
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:02,996
and how that's being a better daughter to him

263
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:06,643
Well all parents say stuff like that

264
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:09,445
My Mom passed away 3 years ago

265
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:11,038
Really?

266
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:16,545
Since losing her, he has become more stubborn and nosy

267
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:40,700


268
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,352
Ah

269
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,158


270
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,839
-Ah, from the hospital....
-No, you're mistaken

271
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:48,208
No, it's you!

272
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,583


273
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,406
Ah.. yeah yeah...

274
00:15:51,406 --> 00:15:52,096


275
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:54,168
You shouldn't drink alcohol

276
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:55,843


277
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,193
Why do you say that...

278
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:57,964


279
00:15:57,964 --> 00:15:59,872
You have an illness

280
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:00,358


281
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:01,228
Ah~

282
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:04,544
I don't mean to be nosy
but what illness do you have?

283
00:16:04,544 --> 00:16:05,949
It's none of your business

284
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,290
It's not

285
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,936
But I can't let a sick person drink

286
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:34,031


287
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:37,054
- Do you need a spoon?
- No

288
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:38,615
- Do you have a point card?
- No

289
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:51,567


290
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:52,593
Eh?

291
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:56,307


292
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,627
I'll just tell you the truth

293
00:16:58,627 --> 00:16:59,654
You know,

294
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:01,768
I was in the hopsital for just summer fatigue,

295
00:17:01,768 --> 00:17:03,875
and ran into your daughter,

296
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,034
and just went along with her story

297
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:07,619


298
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,191
What's your relationship with Natsumi?

299
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:11,953
There's no relationship

300
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:13,438
If there's nothing between you two,

301
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:16,155
how come you lied for her?

302
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:17,912
We just happened to know each other

303
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,568


304
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:22,706
Excuse me

305
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:32,855


306
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:33,384
Eh?

307
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,191


308
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:36,273
What now?

309
00:17:36,273 --> 00:17:38,007
I have a favor to ask

310
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:38,908
Huh?

311
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:40,900
Would you please listen to me?

312
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,909
I'm kind of busy

313
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:50,731


314
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:51,751
What's this?

315
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,621
It's a volume mascara

316
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,975
Ah~ so this is what people use~

317
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,098
It's popular among young people

318
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:01,174
Mmm~ young people huh

319
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:10,518


320
00:18:10,518 --> 00:18:11,616
Hello?

321
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:12,459


322
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,616
Hello

323
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:14,973
Good morning

324
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:15,988
Something wrong?

325
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:16,863


326
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,785
Umm...

327
00:18:18,785 --> 00:18:20,806


328
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:23,800
Can we meet today?

329
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,813
Huh?

330
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,417
With me?

331
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,649
Well yes

332
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,337


333
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:29,785
What for?

334
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:30,634


335
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,488
Do we need a reason to meet?

336
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:33,252


337
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:34,115
Eh?

338
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:34,602


339
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:37,252
I really need to see you

340
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:41,962


341
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,223
Ok

342
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,327


343
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:45,306
Ok

344
00:18:45,306 --> 00:18:46,470
Bye

345
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,648


346
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:50,976
What's wrong?

347
00:18:50,976 --> 00:18:51,281


348
00:18:51,281 --> 00:18:52,750
No, it's nothing

349
00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:02,555


350
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:03,063
Ah

351
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:05,156
- Good morning
- Good morning

352
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:06,937
That's where you were?

353
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:07,648


354
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:11,706
Well, I meet you at "A to Z" cafe

355
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:13,944


356
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,456
Wha~

357
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:17,640
Was that call from Kuwano-san?

358
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,325
Yup

359
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,034


360
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,127
That wasn't anything to hide about...

361
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,911
I wasn't really hiding

362
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,649


363
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,315
You're meeting him?

364
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:25,730


365
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,517
For some reason, he wants to see me

366
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:29,132
Is it a date?

367
00:19:29,132 --> 00:19:30,774
Probably not?

368
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:33,410
But he looked kind of awkward

369
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,667
What if he proposes to you?

370
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,988
No way

371
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:49,264


372
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:49,951
Doctor

373
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:52,372
Lentocan seems finished.  Should I bring it here?

374
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:53,425
Yup, sure

375
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:53,996
Ok

376
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:55,936
Ah sorry

377
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:56,396


378
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,123
I'll be out until the afternoon patients

379
00:19:59,123 --> 00:19:59,816
Huh?

380
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:00,850
Something going on?

381
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,955
Is it a date?

382
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:04,975
Huh?

383
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:06,004
What are you talk about...

384
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,799
It's not

385
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,580


386
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:08,938
Ouch

387
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:36,668


388
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,745
Excuse me

389
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:38,360


390
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,397
Hello

391
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:39,764


392
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:40,301
Hello

393
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:44,009


394
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,594
Would you like to order?

395
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:46,155


396
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:46,592
Ah

397
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:48,473


398
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:50,663
Ice royal milk tea please

399
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:51,807
Ok

400
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:56,122


401
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:57,152
Ah that's right,

402
00:20:57,152 --> 00:21:00,346
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday

403
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:00,985
No problem

404
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:02,279


405
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,207
Umm...

406
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:10,254


407
00:21:10,254 --> 00:21:13,434
Why are you avoiding your father?

408
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:14,306


409
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,309
He probably wants me to go on omiai

410
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,333
Nothing wrong with that...

411
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,203
you being your age and all

412
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:23,442
It's still better that there's talk of omiai than nothing

413
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:23,883


414
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,859
I don't want to hear that from you

415
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:28,020
You being the only daughter,

416
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,904
I think it would be nice to show him his grand kid's face

417
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:34,037
And also,

418
00:21:34,037 --> 00:21:36,987
you shouldn't complain even if the prospect has preivous marriage experience

419
00:21:36,987 --> 00:21:39,312


420
00:21:39,312 --> 00:21:41,634
You brought me out here to tell me that?

421
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,053
Your late mother,

422
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,341
is probably very worried too

423
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:49,588
I told you my Mom passed away?

424
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:51,434


425
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:52,836
I told him that

426
00:21:52,836 --> 00:21:56,628


427
00:21:56,628 --> 00:21:59,827
Since you didn't want to listen to me,

428
00:21:59,827 --> 00:22:03,578
I asked him to bring you out here

429
00:22:03,578 --> 00:22:06,123
How did you two end up conspiring?

430
00:22:06,123 --> 00:22:08,265
We never conspired

431
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:11,339
This guy was so persistent,

432
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,769
so I gave in and cooperated

433
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:17,552
What a way to put it...

434
00:22:17,552 --> 00:22:19,249
But that's the truth

435
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:21,070
But for someone so reluctant,

436
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,191
you did a great job telling her everything on my behalf

437
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:28,648
Well I just told what I heard

438
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,908
It didn't have to be this complicated...

439
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:35,621
You came here to talk about marriage

440
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:39,033
- Well yeah
- Forget it

441
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:40,626
Sorry for being a bad daughter

442
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,458


443
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,413
Is this how you treat other people too?

444
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,518
Yes

445
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:48,643
No, I only do it to you two

446
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:51,543
Well then,

447
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:53,087


448
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:55,284
- I'll express my gratitude later...
- Don't worry about it

449
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:58,199


450
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,530
Please cancel that

451
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,629


452
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,768
Always meddling...

453
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:07,653


454
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:08,240
Bye

455
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,266
Why don't you want to listen to me?

456
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:13,240


457
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,094
Ok I'll listen,
but hurry up

458
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,780
Is that the attitude for listening to a father?

459
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,564
What kind of person are you going to set me up with?

460
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:24,059
You always like the government workers anyway

461
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,518
Always the same type

462
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:32,394


463
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:33,478
Forget it

464
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,407
Just go

465
00:23:34,407 --> 00:23:35,605


466
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:36,306
Oh really?

467
00:23:36,306 --> 00:23:37,957


468
00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:38,704
Excuse me

469
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:55,452


470
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:56,245
Kaneda?

471
00:23:56,245 --> 00:24:13,194


472
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:16,139
Natsumi won't listen to me

473
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:17,230


474
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,491
Is that so

475
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:30,829


476
00:24:30,829 --> 00:24:32,277
What more now?

477
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:34,136
Hotel is this way

478
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:34,565


479
00:24:34,565 --> 00:24:35,902
Well I'm going this way

480
00:24:35,902 --> 00:24:36,346


481
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:38,522
Won't you at least listen to me?

482
00:24:38,522 --> 00:24:41,546
...about what I want to tell Natsumi?

483
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,560


484
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,333
Why me...

485
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:46,871


486
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:49,270
It won't hurt to listen!

487
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,509


488
00:24:50,509 --> 00:24:52,207
I guess

489
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:55,207


490
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:56,599
But

491
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,506
I want to tell Natsumi myself

492
00:24:59,506 --> 00:25:04,061
Please make sure you don't slip your tongue

493
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:05,505
Don't worry,

494
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,301
I never talk to her anyway

495
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,400
Never?

496
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,975
Yes

497
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:19,681


498
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:20,468
What's this~

499
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:22,737
this isn't a date~

500
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:25,080
Sorry for letting you down~

501
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,266
But why is Kuwano-san listening to your father's concerns?

502
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,135
He's twisted and timid,

503
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:33,262
so he caves into anybody more stubborn than him

504
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:38,068


505
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:39,894
Ah!

506
00:25:39,894 --> 00:25:41,995
Drinking beer by himself!

507
00:25:41,995 --> 00:26:15,487


508
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:16,058
Hello?

509
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:16,723


510
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:18,462
Why don't you come over here?

511
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:19,044
Huh?

512
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:19,556


513
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,964
Left, left

514
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:28,071


515
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,206
Nah forget it

516
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:31,241


517
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,744
If you sit there by yourself...

518
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:36,122
I won't be able to enjoy myself

519
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:39,619


520
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:43,865
What a total disaster that was,being caught in between their fight

521
00:26:43,865 --> 00:26:47,905
Things got worse thanks to somebody...

522
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:48,507


523
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,609
Like father like daughter huh

524
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,805
So what did your father want to tell you?

525
00:26:54,805 --> 00:26:56,533
It's about omiai

526
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,323
You're wrong

527
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:57,941
Huh?

528
00:26:57,941 --> 00:26:59,025


529
00:26:59,025 --> 00:27:00,647
He told you something?

530
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:01,802
Well yeah

531
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:03,966
Well then you should say it

532
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:06,038
He wants to tell her directly

533
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:09,364
Why are you being loyal to him anyway?

534
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:10,848


535
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:14,842
He just wants to side with my opponent

536
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,806
Ah~

537
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:18,996
But I was so surprised,

538
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:20,139


539
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,866
To think that her father had such secret

540
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:24,367


541
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,875
Stop egging us on and just tell us!

542
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:27,356


543
00:27:27,356 --> 00:27:28,110
It's secret!

544
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,610
Why is that?

545
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,223
Forget it!

546
00:27:31,223 --> 00:27:31,758


547
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:35,283
So you get into this kind of argument everyday
when you get married huh

548
00:27:35,283 --> 00:27:37,520
No one is going to marry you!

549
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,798
I'm talking in general

550
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:39,764


551
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:42,675
I don't think this happens in general...

552
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:52,261


553
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:53,808
- Waited long?
- Yep

554
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:54,982


555
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:56,778
You look great today

556
00:27:56,778 --> 00:27:58,110
Really?

557
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,507


558
00:27:59,507 --> 00:28:00,685
You look great too

559
00:28:00,685 --> 00:28:01,537
Thank you

560
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:02,378
Welcome

561
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:03,262


562
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:04,030
Ah

563
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,380


564
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,259
Hello

565
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,415
Yes

566
00:28:06,415 --> 00:28:16,784


567
00:28:16,784 --> 00:28:18,130
I'll have the usual... double!

568
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:18,887
Hey

569
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:19,331


570
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,753
Do you want to meet my parents?

571
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:22,465


572
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:25,343
Isn't it a bit early?

573
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:28,184
I want to introduce you to my Dad

574
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:28,869
No?

575
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:31,026


576
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:34,675
He wants to build a house with high ceiling~..

577
00:28:34,675 --> 00:28:36,228
I want to meet him

578
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:36,936
Really?

579
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:38,393
I'm so happy~

580
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:44,291


581
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,024
Ah you're finally here

582
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,704
Please wait a minute

583
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:48,080


584
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,634
What?

585
00:28:48,634 --> 00:28:54,375


586
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,053
I bought this on my way home

587
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:58,180
I didn't think I can finish them

588
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,636
But why me?

589
00:28:59,636 --> 00:28:59,956


590
00:28:59,956 --> 00:29:01,511
No special meaning

591
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:03,370
I was buying mine anyway

592
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:11,440


593
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,741
Well in return, can you tell me what Natsumi-san's father said?

594
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:18,596
No

595
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:25,039


596
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,482
If you make two entrances, the parents' kitchen will get too dark

597
00:29:28,482 --> 00:29:30,163
You're right

598
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:32,242
What about we move it upstair?

599
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:33,025
No

600
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:33,573


601
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:35,032
Sorry

602
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:35,760


603
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,234
That client from the other day
the father is fighting back

604
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:40,692
So I guess he wants only one entrance?

605
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:41,537
That's right

606
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:44,406
In the end, the parents hold the purse string

607
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:47,320
Until they decide, can you the stop the work?

608
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,315
But I was working on it...

609
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:51,286
Sorry, I'll make some coffee~

610
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:52,543


611
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,148
There's a bon odori (Bon festival) at Mariama Center tonight

612
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:56,898
I hear there will be street vendors

613
00:29:56,898 --> 00:29:59,415
Since you have time, why don't you go?

614
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:00,588
Boring~

615
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:05,045


616
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:07,968
Kuwano-san didn't tell me after all

617
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:08,754


618
00:30:08,754 --> 00:30:10,697
It's ok.  Just drop it.

619
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:12,523
Doesn't it bother you?

620
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:13,617


621
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:16,541
If my Dad changes his old ways,

622
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,199
then maybe I'll listen to him

623
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:18,885


624
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:22,842
Your Dad sounds like a diffcult character...

625
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:23,354


626
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:27,921
Why can't men like Dad and Kuwano-san be honest?

627
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:31,868
Isn't that too small a sample?

628
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:33,103
That's true

629
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:36,529


630
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:37,547
Ah

631
00:30:37,547 --> 00:30:39,191


632
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:41,173
Sample no. 2

633
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:41,660
Ah

634
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,660


635
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,495
He's catching goldfish by himself...

636
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:46,189


637
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:48,568
Is he going to raise them?

638
00:30:48,568 --> 00:30:51,473


639
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:53,116
Ah~

640
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:54,817
That's too bad

641
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:55,530


642
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,103
That's not going to work

643
00:30:57,103 --> 00:30:57,799


644
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,176
Sir, one more

645
00:30:59,176 --> 00:30:59,898
Ok

646
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:00,666


647
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:01,202
Here

648
00:31:01,202 --> 00:31:02,343


649
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:04,330
First you have to check the front,

650
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,951
and make sure the glued side faces up

651
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:10,438
If not, then the water will collect and rip

652
00:31:10,438 --> 00:31:10,899


653
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:15,208
Then get close...

654
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,349


655
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:20,933
Pick a target, and put the net in angle

656
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,149


657
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:25,407
As you zone in on the fish,
you put the net underneath

658
00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:26,587


659
00:31:26,587 --> 00:31:30,177
The important thing is
not to move clumsily

660
00:31:30,177 --> 00:31:31,990


661
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,335
The problem begins here

662
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:35,048


663
00:31:35,048 --> 00:31:37,957
You have to control the fish and water,

664
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:39,113


665
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,434
so the movement of the fish doesn't rip the net

666
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:42,151


667
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:45,896
And put the fish on the net

668
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:47,707


669
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:48,633
I did it!

670
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:50,314
Thank you sir!

671
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:58,212


672
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,221
Ah that's too bad...

673
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:00,872
One more

674
00:32:00,872 --> 00:32:01,958


675
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:04,149
You came last year too right?

676
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:05,742
This one's on me

677
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:08,456


678
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:09,647
Good luck!

679
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:15,664


680
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:17,005
Shall we go?

681
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:17,880
Let's go

682
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:36,781


683
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:38,297
Can I just buy it?

684
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:43,166


685
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:45,555
Welcome~  How many?

686
00:32:45,555 --> 00:33:17,048


687
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:18,361
Welcome

688
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:18,783


689
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:20,538
I'll have the usual

690
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:22,319
Ok

691
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:34,683


692
00:33:34,683 --> 00:33:37,421
- Welcome
- Six people

693
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:40,507
Ah.. well...

694
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:45,469
We have seats here and there, separated...

695
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:46,911
It's separate tables...

696
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:52,910


697
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,166
Shall we go somewhere else?

698
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,703
I'm sorry

699
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:56,721
Let's go

700
00:33:56,721 --> 00:34:14,599


701
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:15,488
Hello

702
00:34:15,488 --> 00:34:15,824


703
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:17,150
What now?

704
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,572
No,

705
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:18,137


706
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:19,399
I don't have any

707
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:21,657
I just wanted to,

708
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:22,101


709
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,494
give this to Natsumi

710
00:34:24,494 --> 00:34:26,602
But with what happened and all,

711
00:34:26,602 --> 00:34:28,431
I'd like you to have it

712
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:30,547
I don't have any reason to accept it

713
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:33,277
I came here just to give it to you

714
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:36,210
just-to-give-it to you

715
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:43,118


716
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:46,790
Would you mind waiting a moment?

717
00:34:46,790 --> 00:35:09,201


718
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,220
As a return...

719
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,745
Ah.. what's this?

720
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:13,455


721
00:35:13,455 --> 00:35:14,852
They're meat-filled buns

722
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,486


723
00:35:16,486 --> 00:35:17,563
Here

724
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:18,018


725
00:35:18,018 --> 00:35:18,774
Ah...

726
00:35:18,774 --> 00:35:20,240


727
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,349
I can't eat all these

728
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:24,488


729
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:26,869
Then I'll have one

730
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:27,695


731
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:28,901
Ok

732
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:30,219


733
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:31,518
Ittadakimasu

734
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:47,090


735
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:47,757
Delicious

736
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:50,295


737
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:54,149
Did you tell it to Natsumi?

738
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:54,827


739
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:56,107
I didn't

740
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:56,491


741
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:57,781
Eh, why not?

742
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,499


743
00:35:58,499 --> 00:35:59,924
You told me not to

744
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,962
But people tell anyway

745
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:04,828
What are you talking about

746
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:06,264


747
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,480
Fine,

748
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,702
I'll tell her

749
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:10,507
You don't need to tell!

750
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:12,374
I don't understand

751
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:14,583


752
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,438
Ah!

753
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:16,279


754
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,472
Michiru you are so fast!

755
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:19,808
Fast, really?

756
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:21,390
I am pretty good

757
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,736


758
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:24,718
well that's that

759
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:26,176
I'm leaving

760
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:26,849


761
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,135
Is that ok really?

762
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,706


763
00:36:30,706 --> 00:36:32,422
Ah, Kuwano-san

764
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:33,206
Ah

765
00:36:33,206 --> 00:36:34,509


766
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:36,268
Ah you caught one

767
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:37,876


768
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:39,266
It's so cute

769
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:42,368


770
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,180
Please go catch one more

771
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,112
Huh?

772
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:48,248
He's going to be lonely

773
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,276
He'll want a partner

774
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:51,932


775
00:36:51,932 --> 00:36:54,836
You don't understand the trouble I went through to catch just one

776
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:56,744
It's for his sake

777
00:36:56,744 --> 00:37:07,549


778
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:08,928
Did you throw up?

779
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:09,650
Yes

780
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,458


781
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,679
It's a mild food poisoning

782
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,361
Nothing major

783
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:16,864
Food poisoning?

784
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:17,381


785
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:19,201
What did you eat?

786
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:19,906


787
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:20,527
Ah

788
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:21,058


789
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:23,205
Did you eat something weird at that restaurant?

790
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:23,707


791
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:24,889
No I didn't

792
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:25,989


793
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:28,350
Last night I had steaks..

794
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:28,892
Ah

795
00:37:28,892 --> 00:37:30,061


796
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:31,728
What is it?

797
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:34,704
I ate the meat-filled buns from the neighbor

798
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:36,715
but it hadn't been in the fridge

799
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:40,272
That's no good, if you don't keep them in fridge in this weather

800
00:37:40,272 --> 00:37:40,918


801
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:42,944
Well I'll prescribe you some medicine

802
00:37:42,944 --> 00:37:43,618
Thank you very much

803
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:46,961


804
00:37:46,961 --> 00:37:47,436
Ah

805
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:48,505


806
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,059
What is it?

807
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,283


808
00:37:51,283 --> 00:37:53,061
Your father ate it too

809
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:54,190


810
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,454
By now, he's probably...

811
00:37:57,454 --> 00:38:02,568


812
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:04,418
Well, I don't care

813
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:05,695
Really?

814
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:06,013


815
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:06,566
Well then

816
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:07,542


817
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,252
Please wait a minute

818
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:21,641


819
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,702
He's not picking his cell

820
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:24,250


821
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,435
If he's sick, he'll come to the hospital

822
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:28,319


823
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:29,545
I guess so

824
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:33,428
Ah there were 3 left
I wonder if he ate them all...

825
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:34,316
Huh?!

826
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:34,933


827
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:35,531
Bye

828
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:38,860


829
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,423
Where is he stayng?

830
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:44,223
Um... I did hear the hotel name...

831
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:45,639
Try to remember it

832
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,159


833
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,315
But,

834
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:48,682
I thought you didn't care?

835
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:49,586
Enough!

836
00:38:49,586 --> 00:38:51,991


837
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:53,111
Edward hotel

838
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,864
Edward hotel huh

839
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:55,621


840
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:59,045
Was it Adrian hotel?
No, that's from Rocky

841
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,926


842
00:39:00,926 --> 00:39:02,013
Victoria?

843
00:39:02,013 --> 00:39:04,503
I think it was some aristocratic name...

844
00:39:04,503 --> 00:39:05,080


845
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,941
Renoir... maybe that's a cafe?

846
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:13,130


847
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,596
Ouch

848
00:39:13,596 --> 00:39:15,601


849
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:16,489
This way

850
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:23,894


851
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:24,405
Yes?

852
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,079


853
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,359
Doctor call

854
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,121


855
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:35,638
I did feel sick since the morning, but not enough to warrant a doctor call

856
00:39:35,638 --> 00:39:37,972
Well just lie down

857
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:49,708


858
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:51,756
You gave me weird stuff...

859
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,575
I never said to eat them all

860
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:54,338


861
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:56,437
It's food poisoning

862
00:39:56,437 --> 00:40:00,243
Please eat something light for awhile

863
00:40:00,243 --> 00:40:13,490


864
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,044
I guess you're a doctor after all

865
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:16,599


866
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,528
Of course

867
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:25,114


868
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:25,827
What's this?

869
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:29,133


870
00:40:29,133 --> 00:40:32,295
I don't even know if I'm going to get married or not

871
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:35,541
You don't have to go this far!

872
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,242


873
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:39,682
Who said anything about YOUR wedding?

874
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:40,210


875
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:40,752
Huh?

876
00:40:40,752 --> 00:40:44,867


877
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:47,016
It's MY wedding

878
00:40:47,016 --> 00:40:48,602


879
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:50,362
Yours?

880
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:53,566


881
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:56,859
I met her from the hiking club

882
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,820
She's a good person

883
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:04,509


884
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,868
Well you should've told me....

885
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:08,328


886
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:10,265
I wanted to tell you,

887
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:12,436
and get your approval

888
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,446
But you...

889
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:16,476
But you did really say...

890
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,174
Because you weren't willing to listen!

891
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:33,644


892
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:34,552
Congratulations

893
00:41:34,552 --> 00:41:43,271


894
00:41:43,271 --> 00:41:46,051
Can I go to the wedding?

895
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:46,549


896
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:47,299
You silly

897
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:47,908


898
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:49,425
That goes without saying

899
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,333


900
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:56,337
I set the date on the 20th so you can come

901
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:57,066
What?

902
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:58,541


903
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:02,166
How did you know I have off on the 20th?

904
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:05,355
I heard it while I was at the hospital

905
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:10,090


906
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,725
Now only your wedding is left

907
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:14,537
Here we go again...

908
00:42:14,537 --> 00:42:15,112


909
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:17,905
Well, I'll get going

910
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,040


911
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,671
Kuwano-san,
For your help this time,

912
00:42:21,671 --> 00:42:22,888
You thank him too

913
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:26,084


914
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,240
Thank you very much

915
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,058
I hope you find a good person...

916
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:31,845
Ah!

917
00:42:31,845 --> 00:42:34,730
If it's ok, I can set up an omiai..

918
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,033
No thank you

919
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:37,675
Just because you're marrying,

920
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:40,131
plase don't pull other people in too

921
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,278
Bye

922
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:41,960


923
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,005
"Pull other people in" what the..

924
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:52,790


925
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,757
Mom and Dad's living space is in blue,

926
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:58,766
and the son's family is in yellow

927
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:01,032


928
00:43:01,032 --> 00:43:03,420
How about here?

929
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:03,905


930
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:06,316
That's livingroom and kitchen

931
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:06,782


932
00:43:06,782 --> 00:43:07,831
Um...

933
00:43:07,831 --> 00:43:08,297


934
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:13,319
Livingroom and kitchen will be shared from the both sides

935
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,785
According to Kuwano-san,
with the proposed budget,

936
00:43:15,785 --> 00:43:19,753
it wasn't enough to build two sets of kitchen and livingroom

937
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:21,002
That's right

938
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:21,702


939
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:23,361
Besides, in the house,

940
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:25,815
there should be a place where everbody can talk,

941
00:43:25,815 --> 00:43:29,293
and maybe even argue

942
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:32,306
That's fine with us

943
00:43:32,306 --> 00:43:33,668


944
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:36,336
Are we really short of budget?

945
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:37,856
We're absolutely short

946
00:43:37,856 --> 00:44:08,854


947
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,716
What is it??

948
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:13,630
Today was Dad's wedding
Here's a present

949
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:16,305
He told me to give it to you

950
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,892
It's probably going to be one of those useless plates

951
00:44:18,892 --> 00:44:19,353


952
00:44:19,353 --> 00:44:20,292
Bingo!

953
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:23,651
Well it doesn't matter
It's just a courtesy

954
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:26,776


955
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:28,743
But I don't understand...

956
00:44:28,743 --> 00:44:31,475
why he's marrying again

957
00:44:31,475 --> 00:44:33,666
She's a really great person

958
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:36,428
I can understand why he'd want to marry

959
00:44:36,428 --> 00:44:37,765
Well at that age,

960
00:44:37,765 --> 00:44:39,390
you don't need to worry about the in-laws

961
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,463
About that...

962
00:44:40,463 --> 00:44:42,760
her mother is very healthy

963
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,157
At 87, she's still kicking!

964
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:48,062
And she's really stubborn!

965
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:51,452
So whoever marries you will end up with...

966
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:55,965
a stubborn father in-law, a stubborn 87 year old grand mother

967
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:56,965
I guess that's true

968
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:58,545
Looks like it'll get harder for you to marry

969
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:00,419
Totally unnecessary concern~

970
00:45:00,419 --> 00:45:01,346
Thank you

971
00:45:01,346 --> 00:45:02,830
Good night

972
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:07,435


973
00:45:07,435 --> 00:45:08,838
Ah, you're here!

974
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:09,604


975
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:13,314
You know, I was thinking...

976
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:15,371
About your father...

977
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:18,192
Don't you think he and Kuwano-san are alike?

978
00:45:18,192 --> 00:45:18,999


979
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,634
Mmm.. there are subtle differences...

980
00:45:21,634 --> 00:45:24,966
My Dad is stubborn
Kuwano-san is just cynical

981
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:28,181
Well they're both peculiar

982
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:30,622
I think it's your fate to meet these people

983
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:31,969


984
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:33,104
I'm going to wait...

985
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:35,428
to meet a normal person

986
00:45:35,428 --> 00:46:00,911


987
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,355
See if you get married,

988
00:46:03,355 --> 00:46:04,809
you need to be alert,

989
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:05,670


990
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,690
the water gets dirtier,

991
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,756
oxygen gets halved

992
00:46:09,756 --> 00:46:10,197


993
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:12,446
It's better to be alone

994
00:46:12,446 --> 00:46:13,255
Right?
